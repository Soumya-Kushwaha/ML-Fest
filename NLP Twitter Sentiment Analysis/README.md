## Goal
The goal of this project is to build, train, test, and deploy an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to predict sentiment from thousands of tweets. Sentiment prediction involves understanding people's feelings about a product or service.

## Tools
This project utilizes the following tools and libraries:
- Anaconda: Package manager and environment manager for Python.
- Python: Programming language used for developing the AI model.
- Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library for Python.
- Matplotlib: Data visualization library in Python.
- Seaborn: Data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

## Practical Real-World Application
AI/ML sentiment analysis tools empower companies to automatically predict whether their customers are happy or not. The process can be automated without requiring humans to manually review thousands of tweets and reviews. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model can convert textual data into numerical representations and make predictions based on these representations. Sentiment analysis is crucial for companies to gain insights into customer opinions from social media posts and product reviews.

## Data
### Inputs
Twitter tweets (text data)

### Output
Sentiment (0 or 1)

### Hands-on Project: Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project on Twitter Sentiment Analysis is divided into the following tasks:

1. **Task #1: Import Libraries and Datasets**
2. **Task #2: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis**
3. **Task #3: Plot the Word Cloud**
4. **Task #4: Perform Data Cleaning - Removing Punctuation**
5. **Task #5: Perform Data Cleaning - Remove Stop Words**
6. **Task #6: Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization)**
7. **Task #7: Create a Pipeline to Remove Stop Words, Punctuation, and Perform Tokenization**
8. **Task #8: Understand the Theory and Intuition behind Naive Bayes Classifiers**
9. **Task #9: Train a Naive Bayes Classifier**
10. **Task #10: Assess Trained Model Performance**

## How it Works
- Natural language processors (NLP) work by converting words (text) into numbers.
- These numbers are then used to train an Al/ML model to make predictions.
- Predictions could be sentiment inferred from social media posts and product reviews.
- AI/ML-based sentiment analysis is crucial for companies to automatically predict whether their customers are happy or not.
- The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews.

## Project Overview
In this case study, we will analyze thousands of Twitter tweets to predict people's sentiment. The AI model will be built using the mentioned tools and libraries, and its performance will be evaluated on test data before being deployed for practical applications.
